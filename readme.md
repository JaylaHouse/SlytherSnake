# Slyther Snake
> ### Description: Our software engineering team: Leo, Jayla, Steve, Shizene, Lauren. 
> _SlytherSnake_ is a fresh new take on the classic game _Snake_. The player controls a snake from a top-down perspective and must navigate a three-dimensional environment while dodging enemies and obstacles. The game is developed in Unity, and we decided to take this project as a team in order to learn more about Unity, C#, and software engineering principles.
> Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com). <!-- If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->

## Technologies Used
- Tech 1 - BitBucket
- Tech 2 - GitKraken
- Tech 3 - Unity
- Tech 4 - CircleCi
- Tech 5 - Bootstrap5


## Features
List the ready features here:
### Dedicated Website: 
> - The game will be shared on its own website. Using Bootstrap5 as the framework, it will include information about the game, not limited to: how to play the game, the rules, and information on the power ups. Related stories are exporting the game in unity and creating the website.
### Revamped Snake: 
> - SlytherSnake will be a new and imporved take on the original snake game. With three dimensional elements, customizability, enemies to dodge, and powerups, it will certainly offer new gameplay. Related stories are learning how to code in unity and learning how to create game environements in Unity.   
### Different Playable Snake Characters: 
> - With at least two different options of different SlytherSnakes, each snake will look and play slightly different. Related stories are costumes and characters.

## SPRINT 2: Next Steps


### Leonardo:
> - Create at least two more sophisticated levels that will be utilized in the actual game. Consider using video game level design principles.
> - Fully migrate a version of the game to be playable on the website
> - Implement a feature of completing level one, then being sent to level2

### Shizene: 
> - Create more realistic looking skin. currently we have a very basic version of snake would like to add skins to the snake to make it look realisitc.
> - Add a feature to add snake lives, it can only hold up to 3 lifes.
> - Add a kill feature for the snake. If the snake hits certain walls of the game it dies if there are no lives.
> - Create more attractive powerups which a player can distinguish from one another.
