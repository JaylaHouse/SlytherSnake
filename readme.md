# Slyther Snake
> ### Description: Our software engineering team: Leo, Jayla, Steve, Shizene, Lauren. 
> _SlytherSnake_ is a fresh new take on the classic game _Snake_. The player controls a snake from a top-down perspective and must navigate a three-dimensional environment while dodging enemies and obstacles. The game is developed in Unity, and we decided to take this project as a team in order to learn more about Unity, C#, and software engineering principles.
> Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com). <!-- If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->

## Technologies Used
- Tech 1 - BitBucket
- Tech 2 - GitKraken
- Tech 3 - Unity
- Tech 4 - CircleCi
- Tech 5 - Bootstrap5


## Features
List the ready features here:
### Dedicated Website: 
> - The game will be shared on its own website. Using Bootstrap5 as the framework, it will include information about the game, not limited to: how to play the game, the rules, and information on the power ups. Related stories are exporting the game in unity and creating the website.
### Revamped Snake: 
> - SlytherSnake will be a new and imporved take on the original snake game. With three dimensional elements, customizability, enemies to dodge, and powerups, it will certainly offer new gameplay. Related stories are learning how to code in unity and learning how to create game environements in Unity.   
### Different Playable Snake Characters: 
> - With at least two different options of different SlytherSnakes, each snake will look and play slightly different. Related stories are costumes and characters.

## Sprint 1 Retrospective

### What went well?

#### Team:
- The communication of each task from every team member was very fluid. 
- Time management was affective, we always found time to meet as a team outside of class.
- Everyone was very proactive with their tasks and helped each other with the resources.
- Everyone in the group got along well with each other. 
- We all have great attitudes when it comes to challenges.
#### Individual:
##### Steve:
-  I was able to manage and create my first unity power up with the help of my team mate Jayla House, and was able to familiarize myself with C Sharp when using Unity. 
##### Jayla:
- Using someone else's code and being able to edit it and use it for my game without too much trouble.
##### Shizene:
- I was able to get myself familiarize with unity. 
##### Lauren:
- learning unity and learning how to make character skins or changes.
##### Leonardo:
- Making a game environment for the snake to move around in. 
### What can I do to improve? 
##### Steve:
- I could be more organise with my work so that I don't scramble all the work to be done on due date or the last two days of the due date.
##### Shizene:
- I could get more familiar with unity. Also learn blender so I can help Jayla with the objects for the game. 
##### Leonardo: 
- Having a clear goal in my mind and visualizing it. I spent too much time thinking instead of simply working. 
##### Jayla:
- I could get more familiar with blender so that when transporting from blender to unity things work how they are intended. 
##### Lauren:
- be more involved on the coding side of things in the Snake Game, my first sprint was me just getting familiar with everything. As well as getting more familiar with unity.

### What might be impending us from performing better?
- Our other classes that require a lot of time and energy.
- Our inexperience with technologies such as Bitbucket and Gitkracken

## SPRINT 2: Next Steps


### Leonardo:
> - Create at least two more sophisticated levels that will be utilized in the actual game. Consider using video game level design principles.
> - Fully migrate a version of the game to be playable on the website
> - Implement a feature of completing level one, then being sent to level2

### Shizene: 
> - Create more realistic looking skin. currently we have a very basic version of snake would like to add skins to the snake to make it look realisitc.
> - Add a feature to add snake lives, it can only hold up to 3 lifes.
> - Add a kill feature for the snake. If the snake hits certain walls of the game it dies if there are no lives.
> - Create more attractive powerups which a player can distinguish from one another. 

### Lauren:
> - Customize snake and create character options for snake skins
> - Assist with building the website for the snake game using BootStrap
> - Integrate unit testing

### Steve:
> - Explore more power ups that can be implemented in the game.
> - Improve the color change power up so that it can change the snake whole body.
> - Implement a stop watch on the speed power up.

### Jayla:
> - Making the snake character and rigging it with a proper skeleton.
> - Create Variation in the snake envonment so that there are hazards the player needs to avoid. 
> - Creating a StartScreen
___

## SPRINT 3: Next Steps


### Leonardo:
> - Create two more additional levels to create more diversified gameplay.
> - Program a way for the player to lose.
> - Implemenent gameplay mechanics that the player can interact with in the levels.
