# Slyther Snake
> Discription: Our software engineering team: {Leo Carmona, Jayla House, Steve Tchagou, Shizene --?, Lauren Taylor } Our project is a fun to play game, where the player is a snake and has to navigate through different level environments trying to get to the end while doging enemies and obstacles. We have decided to take on this project because as a team we beleive it will be a fun project while still challenging to where we will all learn something new by the end.
