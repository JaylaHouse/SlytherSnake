For this first task, I had to watch a tutorial video about the basics of Unity where I had to learn about different tools, features, and the environment of Unity.
More specifically I learned about how to move the player and take input from the user which are commands like up, down, left, and right,
which will help in the build up of “Snake Game” project. The only issue I had while performing this task is understanding the physical aspects options 
in Unity which talks about the contacts between the player and the objects around the game. 
To resolve this issue, I plan on meeting with Jayla House, my team project partner, who is more experience with Unity.
